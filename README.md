#DAY 1 (6/23):  
	I learned the basics of Linux and started to learn Python.  Iterative and recursive lines.  
#DAY 2 (6/24):  
	Started the day by searching for an online class about Python.  Found codeacademy.com, started the 13 hr Python class.  Ran through iterations and recursions again on whiteboard.  Factorial both iterative and recursive.  Intro to random walks, then installed numpy to generate random lists and arrays.
#DAY 3 (6/25): 
	Learned how to trace through code to find errors. Project Euler questions 1 - 3.
#DAY 4 (6/29): 
	Project Eueler 4 - 5.  ipython notebook has new folders.
#DAY 5 (6/30):
	Took a tour of 4 labs at the Photonic labs.  MATLAB class.  Started a game.  Create/save accounts with usernames, passwords, and scores.
#DAY 6 (7/1):
	Finished multiplication game.  Program crashes when string is typed, so I will add an exception handler.
#DAY 7 (7/2):
	Added an exception handler to my game.  Now when any other type is inputed, they can repeat the question with no penalty.
#DAY 8 (7/6):
	Started the day off with linear algebra.  Learned about vectors and matrices and dot products.  Two ipython notebook programs for dot products and unit vectors.  Continued my game and made a few modifications.  Added a timer per question and some print statements to say if the question was wrong or not.  Currently trying to add an exception to handle a string input after the "how many questions" question is asked.
